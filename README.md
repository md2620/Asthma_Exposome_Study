# Asthma_Exposome_Study
This project was aimed at predicting asthma attacks trhough the implementation of 4 machine learning algorithms: KMeans, SVM, Random Forest and Gradient Boost respectively. 
# 2134 asthma cases in the NHANES dataset were matched with a balanced control group based on age, sex and ethnicity (ratio of 4 controls per case).
A total of 105 variables derived from questionnaires' information, demographics, examination and laboratory data was available.
In order to compare the efficiency of the models, a confusion matrix, score metrics (Accuracy, Recall, F1 Score, Precision) and AUC-ROC curve was developed for each model. 
#Please find more infos on the preprocessing steps as well as results in the PDF presentation.
